# Baltimore_Citations_Scraper
 The simplified scraper tool for gathering property code citations from the Baltimore Search Violation Notice/Citation website (https://cels.baltimorehousing.org/Search_On_Map.aspx)

### This script will scrape and process the last 6 months of Baltimore City Citations.
#### Note: Do not browse the internet or have extra tabs open while the scrapper is running.
#### Note: Do not run multiple copies of  the script at once. Copies of APIs do not play well when run at once.
